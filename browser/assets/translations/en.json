Each artist, over the years, discovers small findings on their journey, which together are inevitably unique. That's why the work of an artist who has worked for years is almost always special and valuable."

Moreover, most images I use in my creative process originate from the Internet. Specifically, through chance encounters with random images. These images are abducted by me, and I take ownership of them.

The idea is for the image to propose an open premise, something beyond the pose, and for the viewer to complete it."

This quote from the multifaceted Pepín Tre perfectly illustrates the reason for multidisciplinarity. Genius, divine enlightenment, or inspiration are nothing but mythological clichés. Reality, as always, is much more prosaic: it is failure (real or perceived) that moves an artist to investigate, try new techniques, new ways of reaching the public, etc. On the contrary, I am convinced that success (real or perceived) has a paralyzing capacity and ends up producing artists bored with their own art and themselves."

In 2019, few of us intuited the creative potential of the AI of the time. Old neural networks like StyleGan or Bigbigan stimulated our imagination by creating very interesting monsters. Nowadays, AI-generated art is commonplace and has reached new levels of formal sufficiency. But at that time, the margin of error (loss) was much wider, and accidents produced unheard-of and highly interesting monsters. From 2019 to 2023, the primary source of inspiration for my work shifted from images found on the internet to images that Artificial Intelligences are capable of generating."

Software can also satisfy an artist's curiosity, be flexible, organic, random, disorganized, and unpredictable. Once again, we must value error. It is in the brushstroke that goes slightly beyond the contour, the accident that causes software to distort an image until it aberrates, where the value and originality lie."
